    "This example compares `Principal Component Regression\n",
    "<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_regression>`_ (PCR) and\n",
    "`Partial Least Squares Regression\n",
    "<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression>`_ (PLS) on a\n",
    "toy dataset. Our goal is to illustrate how PLS can outperform PCR when the\n",
    "target is strongly correlated with some directions in the data that have a\n",
    "low variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCR is a regressor composed of two steps: first,\n",
    ":class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA` is applied to the training data, possibly\n",
    "performing dimensionality reduction; then, a regressor (e.g. a linear\n",
    "regressor) is trained on the transformed samples. In\n",
    ":class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA`, the transformation is purely\n",
    "unsupervised, meaning that no information about the targets is used. As a\n",
    "result, PCR may perform poorly in some datasets where the target is strongly\n",
    "correlated with *directions* that have low variance. Indeed, the\n",
    "dimensionality reduction of PCA projects the data into a lower dimensional\n",
    "space where the variance of the projected data is greedily maximized along\n",
    "each axis. Despite them having the most predictive power on the target, the\n",
    "directions with a lower variance will be dropped, and the final regressor\n",
    "will not be able to leverage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "PLS is both a transformer and a regressor, and it is quite similar to PCR: it\n",
    "also applies a dimensionality reduction to the samples before applying a\n",
    "linear regressor to the transformed data. The main difference with PCR is\n",
    "that the PLS transformation is supervised. Therefore, as we will see in this\n",
    "example, it does not suffer from the issue we just mentioned.\n",
