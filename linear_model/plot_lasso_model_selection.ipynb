    "# there are few features or samples. Also, it is able to compute the full path\n",
    "# without setting any hyperparameter. On the opposite, coordinate descent\n",
    "# computes the path points on a pre-specified grid (here we use the default).\n",
    "# Thus it is more efficient if the number of grid points is smaller than the\n",
    "# number of kinks in the path. Such a strategy can be interesting if the number\n",
    "# of features is really large and there are enough samples to be selected in\n",
    "# each of the cross-validation fold. In terms of numerical errors, for heavily\n",
    "# correlated variables, Lars will accumulate more errors, while the coordinate\n",
    "# descent algorithm will only sample the path on a grid.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Note how the optimal value of alpha varies for each fold. This illustrates\n",
