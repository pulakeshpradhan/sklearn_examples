    "#\n",
    "# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.Lasso` is known to recover sparse data\n",
    "# effectively but does not perform well with highly correlated features. Indeed,\n",
    "# if several correlated features contribute to the target,\n",
    "# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.Lasso` would end up selecting a single one of\n",
    "# them. In the case of sparse yet non-correlated features, a\n",
    "# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.Lasso` model would be more suitable.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet` introduces some sparsity on the\n",
    "# coefficients and shrinks their values to zero. Thus, in the presence of\n",
    "# correlated features that contribute to the target, the model is still able to\n",
    "# reduce their weights without setting them exactly to zero. This results in a\n",
    "# less sparse model than a pure :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.Lasso` and may\n",
    "# capture non-predictive features as well.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.ARDRegression` is better when handling gaussian\n",
    "# noise, but is still unable to handle correlated features and requires a larger\n",
    "# amount of time due to fitting a prior.\n",
