    "======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the use of Poisson, Gamma and Tweedie regression on\n",
    "the `French Motor Third-Party Liability Claims dataset\n",
    "<https://www.openml.org/d/41214>`_, and is inspired by an R tutorial [1]_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, each sample corresponds to an insurance policy, i.e. a\n",
    "contract within an insurance company and an individual (policyholder).\n",
    "Available features include driver age, vehicle age, vehicle power, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few definitions: a *claim* is the request made by a policyholder to the\n",
    "insurer to compensate for a loss covered by the insurance. The *claim amount*\n",
    "is the amount of money that the insurer must pay. The *exposure* is the\n",
    "duration of the insurance coverage of a given policy, in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our goal is to predict the expected\n",
    "value, i.e. the mean, of the total claim amount per exposure unit also\n",
    "referred to as the pure premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possibilities to do that, two of which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model the number of claims with a Poisson distribution, and the average\n",
    "   claim amount per claim, also known as severity, as a Gamma distribution\n",
    "   and multiply the predictions of both in order to get the total claim\n",
    "   amount.\n",
    "2. Model the total claim amount per exposure directly, typically with a Tweedie\n",
    "   distribution of Tweedie power :math:`p \\\\in (1, 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will illustrate both approaches. We start by defining a few\n",
    "helper functions for loading the data and visualizing results.\n",
