    "A model that overfits learns the training data too well, capturing both the\n",
    "underlying patterns and the noise in the data. However, when applied to unseen\n",
    "data, the learned associations may not hold. We normally detect this when we\n",
    "apply our trained predictions to the test data and see the statistical\n",
    "performance drop significantly compared to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to overcome overfitting is through regularization, which can be done by\n",
    "penalizing large weights (coefficients) in linear models, forcing the model to\n",

    "information obtained from the training samples.\n",

    "This example illustrates how L2 regularization in a\n",
    ":class:`~sklearn.linear_model.Ridge` regression affects a model's performance by\n",
    "adding a penalty term to the loss that increases with the coefficients\n",
    ":math:`\\\\beta`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularized loss function is given by: :math:`\\\\mathcal{L}(X, y, \\\\beta) =\n",
    "\\\\| y - X \\\\beta \\\\|^{2}_{2} + \\\\alpha \\\\| \\\\beta \\\\|^{2}_{2}`\n",
    "\n",
    "where :math:`X` is the input data, :math:`y` is the target variable,\n",
    ":math:`\\\\beta` is the vector of coefficients associated with the features, and\n",
    ":math:`\\\\alpha` is the regularization strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularized loss function aims to balance the trade-off between accurately\n",
    "predicting the training set and to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regularized loss, the left-hand side (e.g. :math:`\\\\|y -\n",
    "X\\\\beta\\\\|^{2}_{2}`) measures the squared difference between the actual target\n",
    "variable, :math:`y`, and the predicted values. Minimizing this term alone could\n",
    "lead to overfitting, as the model may become too complex and sensitive to noise\n",
    "in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address overfitting, Ridge regularization adds a constraint, called a penalty\n",
    "term, (:math:`\\\\alpha \\\\| \\\\beta\\\\|^{2}_{2}`) to the loss function. This penalty\n",
    "term is the sum of the squares of the model's coefficients, multiplied by the\n",
    "regularization strength :math:`\\\\alpha`. By introducing this constraint, Ridge\n",
    "regularization discourages any single coefficient :math:`\\\\beta_{i}` from taking\n",
    "an excessively large value and encourages smaller and more evenly distributed\n",
    "coefficients. Higher values of :math:`\\\\alpha` force the coefficients towards\n",
    "zero. However, an excessively high :math:`\\\\alpha` can result in an underfit\n",
    "model that fails to capture important patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the regularized loss function combines the prediction accuracy term\n",
    "and the penalty term. By adjusting the regularization strength, practitioners\n",
    "can fine-tune the degree of constraint imposed on the weights, training a model\n",
    "capable of generalizing well to unseen data while avoiding overfitting.\n",
