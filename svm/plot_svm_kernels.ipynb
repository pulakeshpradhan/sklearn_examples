    "This example shows how different kernels in a :class:`~sklearn.svm.SVC` (Support Vector\n",
    "Classifier) influence the classification boundaries in a binary, two-dimensional\n",
    "classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVCs aim to find a hyperplane that effectively separates the classes in their training\n",
    "data by maximizing the margin between the outermost data points of each class. This is\n",
    "achieved by finding the best weight vector :math:`w` that defines the decision boundary\n",
    "hyperplane and minimizes the sum of hinge losses for misclassified samples, as measured\n",
    "by the :func:`~sklearn.metrics.hinge_loss` function. By default, regularization is\n",
    "applied with the parameter `C=1`, which allows for a certain degree of misclassification\n",
    "tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is not linearly separable in the original feature space, a non-linear kernel\n",
    "parameter can be set. Depending on the kernel, the process involves adding new features\n",
    "or transforming existing features to enrich and potentially add meaning to the data.\n",
    "When a kernel other than `\"linear\"` is set, the SVC applies the `kernel trick\n",

    "computes the similarity between pairs of data points using the kernel function without\n",

    "necessary matrix transformation of the whole dataset by only considering the relations\n",
    "between all pairs of data points. The kernel function maps two vectors (each pair of\n",
    "observations) to their similarity using their dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperplane can then be calculated using the kernel function as if the dataset were\n",
    "represented in a higher-dimensional space. Using a kernel function instead of an\n",
