    "This example illustrates the need for robust covariance estimation\n",
    "on a real data set. It is useful both for outlier detection and for\n",
    "a better understanding of the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected two sets of two variables from the Wine data set\n",
    "as an illustration of what kind of analysis can be done with several\n",
    "outlier detection tools. For the purpose of visualization, we are working\n",
    "with two-dimensional examples, but one should be aware that things are\n",
    "not so trivial in high-dimension, as it will be pointed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both examples below, the main result is that the empirical covariance\n",
    "estimate, as a non-robust one, is highly influenced by the heterogeneous\n",
    "structure of the observations. Although the robust covariance estimate is\n",
    "able to focus on the main mode of the data distribution, it sticks to the\n",
    "assumption that the data should be Gaussian distributed, yielding some biased\n",
    "estimation of the data structure, but yet accurate to some extent.\n",
    "The One-Class SVM does not assume any parametric form of the data distribution\n",
    "and can therefore model the complex shape of the data much better.\n",
