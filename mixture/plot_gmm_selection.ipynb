    "This example shows that model selection can be performed with Gaussian Mixture\n",

    "In this case, both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayes\n",
    "Information Criterion (BIC) provide the right result, but we only demo the\n",
    "latter as BIC is better suited to identify the true model among a set of\n",
    "candidates. Unlike Bayesian procedures, such inferences are prior-free.\n",
