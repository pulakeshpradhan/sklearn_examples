    "Gradient Boosting is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak\n",
    "learners, typically decision trees, to create a robust and powerful\n",
    "predictive model. It does so in an iterative fashion, where each new stage\n",
    "(tree) corrects the errors of the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping is a technique in Gradient Boosting that allows us to find\n",
    "the optimal number of iterations required to build a model that generalizes\n",
    "well to unseen data and avoids overfitting. The concept is simple: we set\n",
    "aside a portion of our dataset as a validation set (specified using\n",
    "`validation_fraction`) to assess the model's performance during training.\n",
    "As the model is iteratively built with additional stages (trees), its\n",
    "performance on the validation set is monitored as a function of the\n",
    "number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping becomes effective when the model's performance on the\n",
    "validation set plateaus or worsens (within deviations specified by `tol`)\n",
    "over a certain number of consecutive stages (specified by `n_iter_no_change`).\n",
    "This signals that the model has reached a point where further iterations may\n",
    "lead to overfitting, and it's time to stop training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of estimators (trees) in the final model, when early stopping is\n",
    "applied, can be accessed using the `n_estimators_` attribute. Overall, early\n",
    "stopping is a valuable tool to strike a balance between model performance and\n",
