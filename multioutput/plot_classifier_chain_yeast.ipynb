    "==================================================\n",
    "This example shows how to use :class:`~sklearn.multioutput.ClassifierChain` to solve\n",
    "a multilabel classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most naive strategy to solve such a task is to independently train a binary\n",
    "classifier on each label (i.e. each column of the target variable). At prediction\n",
    "time, the ensemble of binary classifiers is used to assemble multitask prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy does not allow to model relationship between different tasks. The\n",
    ":class:`~sklearn.multioutput.ClassifierChain` is the meta-estimator (i.e. an estimator\n",
    "taking an inner estimator) that implements a more advanced strategy. The ensemble\n",
    "of binary classifiers are used as a chain where the prediction of a classifier in the\n",
    "chain is used as a feature for training the next classifier on a new label. Therefore,\n",
    "these additional features allow each chain to exploit correlations among labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The :ref:`Jaccard similarity <jaccard_similarity_score>` score for chain tends to be\n",
    "greater than that of the set independent base models.\n",
