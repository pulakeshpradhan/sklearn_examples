    "This example compares non-nested and nested cross-validation strategies on a\n",
    "classifier of the iris data set. Nested cross-validation (CV) is often used to\n",
    "train a model in which hyperparameters also need to be optimized. Nested CV\n",
    "estimates the generalization error of the underlying model and its\n",
    "(hyper)parameter search. Choosing the parameters that maximize non-nested CV\n",
    "biases the model to the dataset, yielding an overly-optimistic score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model selection without nested CV uses the same data to tune model parameters\n",
    "and evaluate model performance. Information may thus \"leak\" into the model\n",
    "and overfit the data. The magnitude of this effect is primarily dependent on\n",
    "the size of the dataset and the stability of the model. See Cawley and Talbot\n",
    "[1]_ for an analysis of these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this problem, nested CV effectively uses a series of\n",
    "train/validation/test set splits. In the inner loop (here executed by\n",
    ":class:`GridSearchCV <sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV>`), the score is\n",
    "approximately maximized by fitting a model to each training set, and then\n",
    "directly maximized in selecting (hyper)parameters over the validation set. In\n",
    "the outer loop (here in :func:`cross_val_score\n",
    "<sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score>`), generalization error is estimated\n",
    "by averaging test set scores over several dataset splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below uses a support vector classifier with a non-linear kernel to\n",
    "build a model with optimized hyperparameters by grid search. We compare the\n",
    "performance of non-nested and nested CV strategies by taking the difference\n",
    "between their scores.\n",
