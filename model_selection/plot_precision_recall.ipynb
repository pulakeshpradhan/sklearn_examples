    "Example of Precision-Recall metric to evaluate classifier output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision-Recall is a useful measure of success of prediction when the\n",
    "classes are very imbalanced. In information retrieval, precision is a\n",
    "measure of the fraction of relevant items among actually returned items while recall\n",
    "is a measure of the fraction of items that were returned among all items that should\n",
    "have been returned. 'Relevancy' here refers to items that are\n",
    "postively labeled, i.e., true positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision (:math:`P`) is defined as the number of true positives (:math:`T_p`)\n",
    "over the number of true positives plus the number of false positives\n",
    "(:math:`F_p`).\n",
    "\n",
    ".. math::\n",
    "    P = \\\\frac{T_p}{T_p+F_p}\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall (:math:`R`) is defined as the number of true positives (:math:`T_p`)\n",
    "over the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives\n",
    "(:math:`F_n`).\n",
    "\n",
    ".. math::\n",
    "    R = \\\\frac{T_p}{T_p + F_n}\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows the tradeoff between precision and\n",
    "recall for different thresholds. A high area under the curve represents\n",
    "both high recall and high precision. High precision is achieved by having\n",
    "few false positives in the returned results, and high recall is achieved by\n",
    "having few false negatives in the relevant results.\n",
    "High scores for both show that the classifier is returning\n",
    "accurate results (high precision), as well as returning a majority of all relevant\n",
    "results (high recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "A system with high recall but low precision returns most of the relevant items, but\n",
    "the proportion of returned results that are incorrectly labeled is high. A\n",
    "system with high precision but low recall is just the opposite, returning very\n",
    "few of the relevant items, but most of its predicted labels are correct when compared\n",
    "to the actual labels. An ideal system with high precision and high recall will\n",
    "return most of the relevant items, with most results labeled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of precision (:math:`\\\\frac{T_p}{T_p + F_p}`) shows that lowering\n",
    "the threshold of a classifier may increase the denominator, by increasing the\n",
    "number of results returned. If the threshold was previously set too high, the\n",
    "new results may all be true positives, which will increase precision. If the\n",
    "previous threshold was about right or too low, further lowering the threshold\n",
    "will introduce false positives, decreasing precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall is defined as :math:`\\\\frac{T_p}{T_p+F_n}`, where :math:`T_p+F_n` does\n",
    "not depend on the classifier threshold. Changing the classifier threshold can only\n",
    "change the numerator, :math:`T_p`. Lowering the classifier\n",
    "threshold may increase recall, by increasing the number of true positive\n",
    "results. It is also possible that lowering the threshold may leave recall\n",
    "unchanged, while the precision fluctuates. Thus, precision does not necessarily\n",
    "decrease with recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between recall and precision can be observed in the\n",
    "stairstep area of the plot - at the edges of these steps a small change\n",
    "in the threshold considerably reduces precision, with only a minor gain in\n",
    "recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average precision** (AP) summarizes such a plot as the weighted mean of\n",
    "precisions achieved at each threshold, with the increase in recall from the\n",
